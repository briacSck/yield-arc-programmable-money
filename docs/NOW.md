_Last updated: 2026-07-23 EOD (worker revived + dashboard v2 audit live + verifier hardened & publish-ready + USYC round-trip proven + heartbeat alert VERIFIED + ERC draft written)_

## Session wrap 2026-07-23 — where the next session picks up

**CP2 A-floor is done** (deadline Mon Jul 27 13:59 Paris). This session, in order: found + fixed an
8-day silent RPC outage (worker revived, first WITHDRAW landed 18:24); shipped the verifier
(`@yield-cfo/mandate-verify`, live 5/5 in ~3s) + dashboard v2 audit surface; hardened both via
`/review` (8 findings fixed); proved the USYC venue on-chain (mint+redeem round-trip) + built the
`IVenue` seam; **verified the heartbeat alert fires end-to-end** (controlled `/fail` → alert channel
confirmed buzzing — the outage class can't recur silently now); wrote the **ERC draft** (private).

**Handed off / next-session items:**
- **npm publish** `@yield-cfo/mandate-verify` → CTO (auth-only; `verifier/PUBLISH.md` has the exact
  steps — token or CI/provenance). Package is fully built + bundled + pushed.
- **ERC draft** lives at `docs/ERC-DRAFT.md` — **LOCAL/gitignored, private until Demo Day** (§18.3).
  Briac to skim the falsification section (Meridian/Firmata positioning is his call).
- **CP2 submission** (Briac handles; may ask for presentation help over the weekend). Deck link +
  code link + tracks (DeFi + Agentic Economy).
- Still gated: wire USYC behind the mandate seam (untouchable path, team nod); second implementer +
  attestations (W3).

## 🔴 INCIDENT — Tier-1 worker was silently dead 8 days (2026-07-15 → 07-23) — FIXED

**Found + fixed 2026-07-23.** The live worker logged **759 consecutive FAILED cycles** since
2026-07-15T12:20 UTC — every one `HOLD: cycle inputs failed (RPC Request failed. request limit
reached)`. Last healthy decision: 2026-07-15T12:05. The agent behaved **correctly** (invariant #4:
degraded input → HOLD; it never moved money on bad data); the fault was operational, and **two
single points of failure** hid it:

1. **One RPC host.** The worker ran `ARC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network` alone. Measured
   2026-07-23 against the live mandate: that endpoint + 3 of 4 public Arc endpoints rate-limit
   `eth_getLogs`/`eth_call` at ~1 req/s; **only `rpc.drpc.testnet.arc.io` answered 10/10
   concurrent.** Fix: `arcTransport()` in `agent/src/chain/arc-chain.ts` — an ordered viem
   `fallback` across all working endpoints, wired into the worker read client. `ARC_RPC_URL` is now
   *prepended* as a preference, never the whole pool, so an override can't re-create the SPOF.
2. **Heartbeat blind spot.** `pingFail` fired ONLY on gas exhaustion; a `cycle inputs failed` storm
   pinged SUCCESS every tick → healthchecks.io stayed green over a dead loop. Fix: 3 consecutive
   FAILED cycles now ping `/fail` (same `failStorm` predicate as `computeHealth`). +2 regression
   tests. Money-path (scheduler/decision/executor) logic untouched — only the monitoring branch.

Shipped in `50326a2` on `main`. **Railway did NOT auto-deploy from main** (the worker was deployed
once via CLI on Jul 14 and never re-deployed) — deployed manually via `railway up --service worker`
2026-07-23 ~18:23 UTC. **REVIVED + VERIFIED:** the first cycle on the new code executed a real
on-chain **WITHDRAW 1.859676 USDC** at 18:24 (`onChainMoves` 1→2, mandate reads LIVE again); the
loop is deciding from live chain state and landing moves once more. **Chaos-drill lesson (§15.4):**
the Friday drill kills the worker and checks the alert — it never caught this because the process
stayed *up* while every cycle failed. The failStorm ping closes that exact hole. **VERIFIED
end-to-end 2026-07-23:** a controlled `/fail` ping (healthchecks.io / hc-ping.com) fired the alert
channel — confirmed received. The alerting chain works; the outage class can no longer stay silent.

## Dashboard v2 — machine-audit surface LIVE (2026-07-23)

**The verifier's proof is now on the judge screen.** Deployed via `railway up --service dashboard`;
the public `/api/events` serves an `audit` block (COMPLIANT · 5 moves × 5 invariants · 0 violations
· closest approach $1.00 · 5 verdicts joined by txHash). Built to the §18.2 spec:
- **Scoreboard band** above the decision log (5 invariant chips, magnitude headline, closest-approach,
  inline `npx -y @yield-cfo/mandate-verify`), **hero wiring** (the claim strip's first number is now
  the machine verdict, not a hardcoded `0`), **per-row verdict chips** (join on txHash, supersede the
  client receipt badge; PENDING past the coverage boundary).
- **Data seam:** the proxy fetches `verdicts.json` from the `audit-log` git ref (raw.githubusercontent),
  spliced in parallel with the worker read; every failure path returns null — no plumbing failure ever
  renders red. **Nightly-audit CI** (`nightly-audit.yml`) runs the verifier and appends to the
  `audit-log` ref (07:17 UTC + `workflow_dispatch`). Seeded 2026-07-23.
- **Hardened by `/review`** (two independent adversarial reviewers, 8 findings fixed in `275d789`):
  wrong-verdict guard (unseeded scan → exit 2), dashboard crash + green-spoof on malformed feed,
  CI history-destruction (force-push → append), bounded getBlock. Verifier 19/19 tests green.

## USYC venue — REAL, round-trip proven on-chain (2026-07-23)

**The USYC venue works both directions on Arc testnet.** The USYC Teller (`0x9fdF…C105A`, an
ERC-4626 vault; asset = USDC `0x3600…`, share = USYC `0xe918…b86C`) — the agent wallet is
allowlisted (`subscriptionLimitRemaining` = 1,000,000 USDC/day; Circle's "USDC allowlist" email
wording notwithstanding). **Executed live:**
- **Subscribe** 1 USDC → **0.883398 USYC** (approve `0x9636f289…`, deposit `0x46b1dba7…`). The sub-1
  ratio is USYC's NAV — each share is worth >1 USDC of accrued T-bill value.
- **Redeem** 0.883398 USYC → **0.999903 USDC** (`0xfd6e3a65…`). Agent wallet 6.971204 → 6.954969
  USDC (net ~1.6¢ gas), USYC back to 0. Both legs = the deploy/pull-back pair the CFO loop needs.

Kit: `agent/scripts/usyc-mint-test.ts` (read-only preflight · `--execute --amount <n>` mint ·
`--execute --redeem` unwind; gas-reserve guarded). **Venue adapter shipped:**
`agent/src/chain/usyc-venue.ts` — the `IVenue` seam (read-only previews/allowlist + money-move
*call specs* the `ChainExecutor` signs; never moves money itself, invariant #1). 6 tests + live
smoke. **NOT yet wired into the live loop** — the mandate contract is frozen and the
scheduler/executor path is untouchable; wiring USYC as the mandate's deploy target behind the seam
is the next gated step (needs the team nod, §17.2). Today it's proven + ready, not integrated.

## The Verifier — core shipped (2026-07-23) — the W2 star

**`@yield-cfo/mandate-verify` runs end-to-end against the LIVE chain: full history, 5/5 COMPLIANT,
~6 s.** The CP2 A-floor is met from source today (npm publish + nightly-audit badge are the
remaining CP2 items). Built exactly to the §18.1.2b two-layer spec.

- **Pure replay core** (`verifier/src/core/replay.ts`) — the entire trust surface, zero I/O.
  Reconstructs mandate state event-by-event and re-derives the EXACT predicate the contract
  enforced at each move. Invariant 3 is the exact lazy tumbling-window replay (not a naive rolling
  sum — that false-positives on legal history). 17 tests: one violating fixture per invariant (the
  negative demo) **+** the compliant-adversarial suite that a naive verifier would wrongly flag
  (legal 2× window-boundary burst, cap exactly filled, balance exactly at floor, setMandate
  mid-window, emergencyWithdrawAll→refund→deploy, revoke→withdraw→reinstate, one-block multi-deploy)
  **+** a **golden test against real testnet history**.
- **Receipt check is PURE-CHAIN** — a discovery this session: the on-chain `forecastHash` arg IS
  the `forecastInputsHash` that seeds `decisionId = keccak(forecastHash|kind)`
  (circle-chain-executor.ts:135), verified against all 4 live events. So receipt integrity needs
  **no preimage API at all** — stronger than the plan assumed (the `GET /forecasts` worker route is
  now a *nice-to-have* for full preimage disclosure, not a blocker for invariant 5).
- **fetch layer** (`verifier/src/fetch.ts`) — one address-only `getLogs` per 10k-block chunk,
  `parseEventLogs({strict:false})` (tolerates Arc EIP-7708 native-transfer logs), ordered by
  `(blockNumber, logIndex)`, chainId preflight (a wrong `--rpc` can't fake "vacuously compliant").
  Same measured dRPC-first endpoint pool as the worker fix.
- **Judge DX** (`verifier/src/cli.ts`) — zero-config default (compiled-in mandate/deploy-block/pool),
  `--fixture naive-agent` (negative demo, exits 1) · `--fixture live-snapshot` (offline, exits 0) ·
  `--address`/`--deploy-block` (any conforming deployment) · `--json` · exit codes 0/1/2 · streamed
  progress · screenshot-able COMPLIANT footer with dashboard + explorer URLs.
- **Live verdict 2026-07-23:** `4 moves × 5 invariants, 0 violations`; closest approach **$1.00
  above floor** (a real reconstructed stat, not hardcoded). Deploy block **51743317** (Jul 14
  08:21 UTC), pinned as a package constant.
- **Still ahead for CP2/W3:** npm publish (`--provenance`) · nightly-audit CI → `audit-log` ref →
  dashboard `/api/events` `audit` block + scoreboard band (the design-pinned audit surface) ·
  `GET /forecasts?inputsHash` worker route for full preimage disclosure · ERC draft. See `TODOS.md`.

## The Underwriter — CMA beat shipped (2026-07-22)

**The W3 §18 underwriter beat is live as an independent Claude Managed Agent** (`underwriter/`). A *separate* hosted agent — not the CFO — assesses the mandate at arm's length from public read-only data, prices the disclosed stub premium, and issues a certificate on a daily schedule, graded by its own Outcome rubric. It consumes existing surfaces only; it touches none of the untouchable path.

- **Independent arm's-length assessor**: fetches the public dashboard (`/api/events`), writes its own viem script to cross-check the `AgentMandate` getters on Arc (floor/ticket/dailyCap/revoked/balances) + agent gas, computes risk stats, and prices `premium = f(floor, caps, verified history)` as disclosed `stub-v0`. First run graded **satisfied**; premium **0.0851 USDC/30d**. Output in `underwriter/certificate.json` + `memo.md` (14 PASS / 2 PENDING / 1 UNVERIFIED — data gaps never rendered as violations).
- **Read-only by construction**: cloud env with `networking: limited` (2 hosts — dashboard + Arc RPC), `web_fetch`/`web_search` disabled, no keys, no transactions. Cannot move money.
- **Machine-verify wired**: tries `npx -y @yield-cfo/mandate-verify --json` each run and falls back silently on 404 (`degraded-heuristic` today); flips to `machine-verified` with zero code change when the verifier publishes. Offline proof in `underwriter/proof/`.
- **Human-gated bind** (`underwriter/bind/`): on-demand approve/deny flow for issuing coverage — added session-locally so it stays OFF the unattended daily schedule (an approval gate would hang an unattended run). Demoed end-to-end: policy `POL-d2fa68`.
- **Runs itself**: daily scheduled deployment 07:00 America/Los_Angeles. Self-contained results viewer in `underwriter/viewer/`.
- Still roadmap: on-chain parametric-cover escrow + oracle trigger, and Nanopayments/ERC-8183 agent-to-agent premium settlement (see `TODOS.md`).

## PLAN v3 APPROVED (2026-07-14 evening) — W2 build order

Full spec lives in the local plan (§18, four pinned layers: design/eng/DX/narrative). Team-safe summary — W2 lanes in order:
1. **Worker preimage route FIRST**: one additive `GET /forecasts?inputsHash=0x…` in `agent/src/server.ts` + worker redeploy (scheduler/decision/executor untouched — that's the redefined "untouchable" boundary).
2. **`verifier/` package**: two-layer (fetch → pure replay core); 5 invariants machine-checked over full mandate history; invariant 3 = EXACT lazy-tumbling-window replay (naive rolling sums = false alarms); both fixture suites (violating + compliant-adversarial ≥8) + live-history golden test; bundled single-file CLI, zero-config defaults, `--fixture`, exit codes 0/1/2, <60 s budget asserted in CI. Degraded ship path if 5/5 slips past **Wed Jul 22**: receipt-check-only for CP2, disclosed.
3. **Audit surface on the dashboard**: scoreboard band above the log (5 invariant chips + "N moves × 5 invariants — 0 violations" + closest-approach stat) + per-row verdict chips (PASS/VIOLATION/PENDING/UNVERIFIED — never "FAILED"; post-revoke blocked moves render `BLOCKED — mandate enforced` in sage). Verdicts arrive via nightly CI → `audit-log` git ref → proxy splice into `/api/events`. No plumbing failure may ever render red.
4. **ERC draft** (Briac, ≤3 afternoons): interface + invariants + prior-art falsification (incl. Enzyme/Zodiac) + normative hash rules + fixture files as conformance vectors.
5. **README top fold at CP2**: claim one-liner, `npx -y` block, nightly-audit badge, dashboard link, mandate address + arcscan, Circle tools named, three trust tiers.

**Vadim nods pending (one batch):** shared-schema cap fields (below) + venue seam + mandate-interface generalization + AgentMandate/trade-gate sims review.
**Today-actions:** npm scope ✅ LOCKED: org `yield-cfo` registered on npm (2026-07-14) — the judge command is `npx -y @yield-cfo/mandate-verify`, safe to print in CP1/deck. `TODOS.md` now tracks deferred items (incl. the decisionId NatSpec errata — fold into the first verifier PR).

## DAY 2b — what shipped

**TRADE MODE IS LIVE (supervised day, gate f).** The scheduler now decides from LIVE chain state
each cycle and executes through the mandate on its own: **first scheduled autonomous DEPLOY
2 USDC** `0x9b9d5ee2…4ffde7` at 09:58 UTC (cycle #1), then cycle #2 correctly SKIPPED on the 6h
anti-oscillation cooldown. The compounding on-chain clock started 2026-07-14.

- **Loop economics hardened** (`39326a3`): dip predicate partitions risk-on/risk-off seasons (no
  deploy INTO a projected crunch → no ping-pong); engine clamps deploys to live mandate caps
  (`DecisionConfig.maxTicketUsdc/dailyCapRemainingUsdc`, additive — **Vadim: schema nod needed**,
  same batch as the venue seam); scaled Boulangerie ledger (1:3800) anchored on TOTAL liquidity;
  6h cooldown; gas preflight → heartbeat FAIL; out-of-line `forecasts.jsonl`; torn-line-tolerant
  log with seq resume (proven across live restarts); trade-gate sims (a)(b)(c)(g) green — 39/39.
- **Dashboard v1 built** (`669bc73`): claim strip w/ live counters · forecast cone as ledger
  horizon (P10–P90 fan, floor rule, decision markers) · decision log (weighted moves + ✓ receipt
  badges, quiet HOLDs, honest FAILED) · on-chain mandate contract panel · uptime strip · revoked
  full-page mode. English, USDC formatter, UTC times, 1:3800 scale chip, paper/ink/sage + Geist.
  UI has ZERO chain reads — one route proxying the worker.
- **Worker HTTP surface**: `/events` (stats + latest forecast + tail + 15s-cached mandate
  snapshot + agent gas), `/health` (content-based: FAILED-storms and gas death read degraded even
  when fresh).
- Executor: retry-once on Circle first-connection resets (caught live on cycle #0).

## Railway state — DEPLOYED ✅ (2026-07-14 ~11:18 UTC)

Two services live on project `yield-agentic-cfo`: `worker` (loop + /data volume + internal
:8787, trade mode, 15-min cycles) + `dashboard` (public URL above, proxies the worker). The
Railway worker's **first autonomous cycle deployed 2 USDC on its own** (`0xf0b60b…dc44`) —
daily budget now 4.98/5.00, caps visibly binding. Local loop KILLED (one owner). Deploy
gotchas for the record: Railway builds with **Railpack** (NIXPACKS_* vars ignored) → root
`start`/`build` dispatch on `RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME` (`scripts/railway-*.mjs`); Circle SDK needs
the ESM/CJS interop import (`agent/src/chain/index.ts`); Node pinned to 24 (`.node-version`).
Redeploying the dashboard NEVER touches the worker — iterate UI freely.

## Video shot list v1 (§11 beats → shots; build B-roll against these)

1. **Open (0:00–0:20)**: dashboard claim strip close-up — "running unattended since Jul 14 ·
   N on-chain decisions · 0 floor breaches", then zoom out to full page.
2. **The brain (0:20–0:50)**: cone close-up — floor rule + P10 fan; cut to identity badge →
   arcscan registry (agentId 850878).
3. **Beat 1 — deploy (0:50–1:20)**: decision-log row appears (DEPLOY + reason sentence) →
   click tx → arcscan confirmation ~2s → back to cone, marker lands on the horizon.
4. **Beat 2 — pull-back (1:20–1:45)**: pre-payroll dip: P10 crosses floor on the cone →
   WITHDRAW row "pulling funds back ahead of the crunch" → arcscan.
5. **Beat 3 — exposure (W3, once SPICE leg lands)**: wheat shock → FLOOR_RAISE row w/ exposure.
6. **Kicker (2:10–2:25)**: owner revoke tx → full-page revoked mode (banner + greyed cone +
   "MANDATE REVOKED" rule) → attempted deposit FAILS → withdraw still succeeds → reinstate.
   (All five beats already recorded on-chain 2026-07-14 — links in git history/NOW archive.)
7. **Close (2:25–3:00)**: architecture flash naming Circle tools (Wallets, Contracts/SCP,
   native-USDC gas, ERC-8004/8183) → traction line → "we'll be working on this either way."

## User actions (time-sensitive)

- ✅ Team confirmed (Vadim + Sara in). ✅ Sleep off on the dev machine.
- ✅ Railway billing + deploy (done 07-14). ✅ **Heartbeat monitoring LIVE** (healthchecks.io,
  15-min period / 10-min grace; worker pings every cycle, POSTs `/fail` on gas exhaustion —
  weekly Friday chaos drill per §15.4: kill the worker, verify the alert fires).
- ✅ USYC ticket submitted + acknowledged — ⏳ answer their additional-info request.
- CP1 blurb (§10) by Saturday · Corey ping (draft delivered 07-14) · 30-min Discord recon.
- **Vadim**: nod on two additive changes — venue seam (§17.2 IVenue) + `DecisionConfig` cap
  fields (shipped, flagged); review AgentMandate + the trade-gate sims.

## Reminders

- Local loop = the only runner until Railway is green. One owner at a time — never both in trade.
- Never cut: Tier-1 uptime, decision receipts, mandate revoke, video quality, submit Aug 8.
